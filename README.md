# api_to_s3_etl
Let's hit an API, transforms the results, and put them in S3!

# Overview

This is a comparison of [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), which are both new to me.

In it, both tools are used to hit an [API](https://newsapi.org/), transform the results, and put them into [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

See the [airflow](./airflow) and [prefect](./prefect) directories for the respective sets of requirements and usage.
